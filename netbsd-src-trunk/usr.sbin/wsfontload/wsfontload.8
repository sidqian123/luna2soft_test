.Sh NAME
.Nm wsfontload
.Nd "load a font bitmap into the wsfont pool or a wscons display device"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Bbv
.Op Fl e Ar encoding
.Op Fl f Ar wsdev
.Op Fl h Ar height
.Op Fl N Ar name
.Op Fl w Ar width
.Op Ar fontfile
.Nm
.Fl l
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility loads a font bitmap into the wsfont font pool
(or a wscons device if the device driver supports this).
The font gets assigned a name in this process which it can be referred to
by later for use on a display screen.
The font is loaded from the specified
.Ar fontfile ,
or from standard input if
.Ar fontfile
is not provided.
.Pp
The options are:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl B
Specifies that the font data is ordered right-to-left byte wise.
The default is left-to-right.
.It Fl b
Specifies that the font data is ordered right-to-left bit wise.
The default is left-to-right.
.It Fl e Ar encoding
Sets the encoding of the font.
This can be either a symbolic name or a numeric value.
Currently recognized names are:
.Bl -tag -width Ql
.It Ql iso
ISO-8859-1 encoding
.It Ql ibm
IBM CP437 encoding
.It Ql pcvt
the custom encoding of the supplemental fonts which came with the
.Bx
.Dq pcvt
console driver
.It Ql iso2
ISO-8859-2 (Eastern European) encoding
.It Ql iso7
ISO-8859-7 (Greek) encoding
.It Ql koi8r
KOI8-R (Russian) encoding
.El
.Pp
Per default,
.Ql iso
is assumed.
.It Fl f Ar wsdev
Specify the device to operate on.
Default is
.Pa /dev/wsfont .
.It Fl h Ar height
Sets the height of a font character in pixels.
Default is 16.
.It Fl l
Print a list of fonts that have been loaded or are built-in to the kernel.
.It Fl N Ar name
Specifies a name which can be used later to refer to the font.
If none is given, the
.Ar fontfile
name is used to create one.
.It Fl v
Prints the font's properties before loading it.
.It Fl w Ar width
Sets the width of a font character in pixels.
Default is 8.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
supports
.Ql \&.wsf
file format that contains the necessary information about the font in
the font file itself.
Such files can be loaded without specifying any arguments,
though
.Fl N
can be used to override the font name.
.Pp
Typically, the
.Nm
utility will be executed during system startup by the
.Xr rc 8
script.
See
.Xr wscons.conf 5 .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -item -compact

.Sh EXAMPLES
Load ISO-encoded 20-pixel high Terminus font
and use it on the current console
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# wsfontload /usr/share/wscons/fonts/ter-120n.wsf
# wsfontload -l | grep Terminus
Terminus20-ISO8859-1 10x20
# wsconsctl -f `tty` -dw font=Terminus20-ISO8859-1
.Ed
.Pp
Load the ISO-encoded 16\[tmu]32 Spleen font
and switch the first console screen to use it:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# wsfontload -w 16 -h 32 -e iso -N spleen32 \e
	/usr/share/wscons/fonts/spleen-16x32.fnt
# wsconsctl -dw font=spleen32
.Ed
.Pp
Load the IBM-encoded 8\[tmu]8-font from the
.Xr wscons 4
distribution:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# wsfontload -N myname -h 8 -e ibm \e
    /usr/share/wscons/fonts/vt220l.808
.Ed
.Pp
This or another 8\[tmu]8-font is necessary to use the
50-line screen type on
.Xr vga 4
displays.
