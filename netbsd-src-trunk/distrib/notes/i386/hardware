runs on all i486 or later PC-compatible systems with 1 to 32 processors.
The minimal configuration for a full, standard installation is 64MB of RAM
and 2GB of disk space.

NetBSD requires a numeric co-processor.
The target system must
have one of the following processors:
.(bullet
an i486DX or compatible
.It
an i486SX with an i487 numeric co-processor installed
.It
a Pentium compatible or later processor
.bullet)
On extremely memory starved systems, a custom installation of
.Nx
with a stripped-down kernel can be performed manually.
That procedure is not documented here.
