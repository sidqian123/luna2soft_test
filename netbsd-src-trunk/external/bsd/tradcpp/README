To update tradcpp to a new version:

- Unpack the tradcpp distfile. Unless things have changed a lot
  upstream, you can import the distribution directory directly as
  external/bsd/tradcpp/dist without needing to munge or prepare it.
- Update the build glue/reacharound makefile, if needed. For the
  moment, we just include the distribution makefile as it's suitable,
  and therefore things like source lists don't need to be synced. If
  the distribution makefile becomes unsuitable, this will need to
  change.
- cvs import the new dist directory.
- Merge. (As long as we're stuck using cvs, please avoid committing to
  the default branch in the tradcpp/dist subtree so this step isn't
  necessary, as it's a big headache.)
- Fix any merge conflicts.
- Commit the merge.
- Commit any changes to the build glue.
- Update doc/3RDPARTY with the new version.
- Add a note to doc/CHANGES about the new version.

Note that this is not the maintenance copy of tradcpp; it is
maintained in its own hg repository.

Please if possible avoid committing changes to this version; instead,
please send them upstream. Issuing a new release only takes a few
minutes and allows the fixes/updates to propagate to pkgsrc.
