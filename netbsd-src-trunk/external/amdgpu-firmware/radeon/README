Radeon ships files with the same name for case-insensitive file systems,
and we can't build NetBSD on systems that have case-insensitive file
systems that will be used for the $DESTDIR, we have to install these
into different subdirs, and there needs to be a different locations for
them in the installation.

Workaround this by forcing consumers of the newer radeon firmware files
to have /usr on the same file-system as /, so that /usr/libdata/firmware
can be used for these.

Hopefully these files won't change again, so we don't have to deal with
this ever again.

This subdir installs the lower-case versions.  To avoid repo bloat, the
upper-case versions remain in their current location.
