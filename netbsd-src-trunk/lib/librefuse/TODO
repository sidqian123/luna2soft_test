To Do
=====
address all XXX
implement proper lookup (pending some libpuffs stuff)
support fuse_mt (i.e. worker threads, but that'll probably be smarter
		 to do inside of libpuffs)
support fuse_ll (i.e. "raw" vfs/vnode export)
do proper implementations of dirfillers
Implement filesystem module API appeared on FUSE 2.7 (struct fuse_module).
Support flags and options in struct fuse_file_info. They all are ignored atm.
Support capabilities and other options in struct fuse_conn_info. They all are ignored atm.
Support polling appeared on FUSE 2.8 (struct fuse_pollhandle).
Support data buffers appeared on FUSE 2.9 (struct fuse_buf).
Support fsync operation.
Support access() operation.
Support flock operation.
Support fallocate operation.
Support ioctl appeared on FUSE 2.8 (probably impossible due to incompatibilities with Linux).
