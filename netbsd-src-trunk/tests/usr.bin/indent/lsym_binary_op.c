/* $NetBSD: lsym_binary_op.c,v 1.7 2023/05/13 06:52:48 rillig Exp $ */

/*
 * Tests for the token lsym_binary_op, which represents a binary operator in
 * an expression.  Examples for binary operators are '>>', '=', '+', '&&'.
 *
 * Binary operators are surrounded by blanks.
 *
 * Some tokens like '+', '*' or '&' can be either binary or unary operators,
 * with an entirely different meaning.
 *
 * The token '*' is not only a binary or a unary operator, it is used in types
 * as well, to derive a pointer type.
 *
 * See also:
 *	lsym_postfix_op.c	for postfix unary operators
 *	lsym_unary_op.c		for prefix unary operators
 *	lsym_colon.c		for ':'
 *	lsym_question.c		for '?'
 *	lsym_comma.c		for ','
